## OPENMP | Matrix multiplication

- The user gives the program a size
- The program then multiplies two matrices using the size given by the user with the row-column method.
- The program then displays both sequential and parallel time

## PTHREAD | BFS graph algorithm

- The program calculates the time it takes to solve the algorithm based on the number of threads and nodes given by the user
- The program then displays both sequential and parallel time

## PYTHON | PI approximation using the Monte Carlo algorithm

- The program generates a random point
- The program approximates PI sequentially, then displays the time and the approximation
- The program approximates PI using a processor pool,approximating PI on every thread then calculates the average of all the thread's approximation
- The program then makes a diagram showing the difference between sequential and parallel time
- The program then calculates PI using the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe-formula and shows the difference between the formula and Monte Carlo algorithm
